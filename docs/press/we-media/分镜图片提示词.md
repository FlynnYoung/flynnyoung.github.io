## Camera Language Standards

### Shot Types
- **Extreme Close-up**: Local details, emphasizing emotion or objects
- **Close-up**: Chest and above, showing expressions
- **Medium Shot**: Waist and above, balancing character and environment
- **Full Shot**: Full body, showing action and posture
- **Long Shot**: Character and environment relationship
- **Extreme Long Shot**: Environment-dominated, creating epic scale

### Camera Angles
- **Eye Level**: Objective and neutral
- **High Angle**: Smallness, vulnerability, oppression
- **Low Angle**: Authority, power, intimidation
- **Dutch Angle**: Unease, tension, imbalance
- **Over-the-Shoulder**: Enhanced dialogue interaction

### Composition Principles
- **Rule of Thirds**: Key elements at grid intersections
- **Golden Ratio**: Visual balance and aesthetics
- **Symmetrical**: Stability, solemnity, ritual
- **Leading Lines**: Guide viewer's eye to focal point
- **Framing**: Environment frames the subject
- **Negative Space**: White space creates mood
